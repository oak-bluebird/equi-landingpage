                                        <p>Doug is an experienced and successful businessman who has spent  his  entire career investing in and operating businesses. A Scotsman by origin, Doug graduated in business studies from Glasgow University in 1985. He then went on to qualify as a Chartered Accountant with Deloitte Haskins and Sells in 1988.</p>
                                        <p>Age 22, his first venture was to open 3 paintball sites in Scotland. Awards followed, and his success resulted in international private equity group 3i recruiting him to their investment team. In 1992, he decided to branch out on his own again, setting up and developing a successful corporate finance practice which he exited in 1999 to concentrate on his private investment vehicle, Aston Ventures.</p>
                                        <p>Over the next 10 years, Aston Ventures made 13 acquisitions of old economy businesses with a total turnover in excess of £400 million. In recent years Aston has focused on technology investments and in 2017 led the acquisition of former tech unicorn Ve Global. Since 2008, Doug has built the Knox Group of Companies and, as Founder and Chairman, he oversees a diverse and successful collection of companies whose business activities include private equity, property and wealth management. Knox employs over 350 staff across a number of international locations and has funds under management and administration approaching £3 billion.</p>
                                        <p>EQUI is the brainchild of Doug’s embracement of Blockchain technology and a passion for what the cryptocurrency market can achieve. In 2017 Doug successfully launched the first large scale property development to be available for sale in Bitcoin. EQUI will be another first; offering venture capital opportunities backed by leading entrepreneurs to the crypto community.</p>
